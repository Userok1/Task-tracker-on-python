# Task-tracker-on-python
First project on python

The project is a simple task tracker cli interface thas allows users to manage tasks (add, update, delete)
and mark them with different status (like to-do, in-progress, done)

You have list of commands:
    task-cli add ['description'] (description is description)
    task-cli update [id] ['description'] (id is a task id)
    task-cli delete [id] (id is a task id)
    task-cli mark-in-progress [id] (id is a task id)
    task-cli mark-done [id] (id is a task id)
    task-cli list
    task-cli list done
    task-cli list in-progress
    task-cli list todo

Tasks have ids so you can choose the specific one and invoke a command you want to.
You have the possability list tasks (all of them and by the status).
Thats all.
Thank you.
